# E-commerce Database Schema

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a complete **MySQL relational database schema** for a simple **E-commerce Store**. It is designed for academic and practical use cases, covering real-world features such as product management, user accounts, orders, payments, wishlists, and reviews.

The schema follows **best practices** in database normalization, uses **constraints** to ensure data integrity, and includes **sample seed data** to get started quickly.
